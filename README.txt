Pong - Classic 2-D Pong Game
============================

It's the Pong you know and love, now object-oriented and ready
to grow.
As much as we love Pong, our real intent is to get some usable
game engine classes set up on top of SFML. You'll find the
source for these in the TEMM directory in src. We hope to start
more ambitious projects in the future.
